sentence=High-performance, non-blocking WS2812/SK6812 library for ESP32 with built-in effects.
paragraph=A powerful and efficient library for controlling addressable LEDs (WS2812/SK6812) on the ESP32 using the RMT peripheral. It features a fully non-blocking architecture that doesn't stall the loop(), ideal for projects with real-time tasks like audio processing or networking. Includes helper functions for easy color manipulation (RGB/HSV), gamma correction for superior visual quality, and advanced built-in effects like "Comets".
